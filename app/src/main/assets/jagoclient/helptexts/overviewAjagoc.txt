Go is a board game played from ancient times at east Asia.
There are 4 playing mode.

(1) Through Go server such as WING.
	  (I tested WING only) 
      Connect to selected server on top panel,
      request match to the selected 'foo' on 'who' panel.
      WING server(wing.gr.jp) port is 1515 and encoding=UTF-8
      (2525 and encoding=MS932 for Japanese user). 
      set Language:en_US by TopPanel-ContextMenu:Options-->Set Language.
      Enter once "term e" command just after successful login.

      Link WING:--> http://www.wing.gr.jp/indexe.html
           JagoClient:-->http://jagoclient.sourceforge.net

   At first, select server, push 'Connect' button then enter 'guest'.

(2) Match with the known partner.
      Without Go server, pear to pear matching with partner
      which IP address is known.
      (Device IP address is shown by Main Menu --> Partners)

      Bluetooth enables Peer-to-peer matching without wireless-LAN environment.
      (Main Menu --> Bluetooth --> Help)
(3) LocalView
      Top panel menu, Action-->LocalView.
      This is simply a board view.
      Use it to resolve Composed-Go-Problem, study Go-Master's record,
      or review/make variation of sgf file.
      You can play face-to-face matching if your terminal screen is big enough.
(4) Match with Robot
      Top panel menu, vs Computer --> Gnugo3.8, pachi, fuego, ray.
